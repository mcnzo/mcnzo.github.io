            <h1>Hover Over The Stars</h1>
            <p>Previously among my endeavours, I found a simple game like that brings out the purest moments in life: solving problems<code>&#x2014;</code>in some ways, this small beginning to the coding world reflects the simplicity of solving puzzles for the sake of it. Using the techniques I learned in the Couch to Coder 2024 Series, I am able to leverage a platform in which I can explore innovative ways to hold my knowledge, but that all starts with bringing things back to the basics.</p>
            <p>There is only one way to read more, and that takes some imagination beyond the heading. (Given the timeframe, I am not able to implement an element where by hovering over the stars in the title, more information would be revealed on the page, and this probably requires more knowledge to execute so it will be my intention to keep exploring this further.)</p>
